# FoodRatings Market Research Report
I had some product ideas in mind and used it to research. GPT helped me put together the rest.

## Executive Summary
The food review and ratings industry is dominated by platforms like Google Reviews, Yelp, and TripAdvisor. While these platforms are successful in reach and monetization, they leave critical gaps around **hygiene, cleanliness, and operational improvement**. FoodRatings aims to disrupt this space by focusing on **structured cleanliness metrics, staff training, and actionable insights for restaurant owners**.

This report outlines the current market landscape, competitive benchmarking, monetization models, and positioning opportunities for FoodRatings.

## Market Landscape
- **Google Reviews**: Integrated with Maps; largest reach but limited specialization.
- **Yelp**: Over 308M reviews; strong local influence but credibility issues due to fake reviews and ad bias.
- **TripAdvisor**: Travel-focused; integrates bookings but suffers from overwhelming volume.
- **New Entrants (It’s Good, AmiGo, Places)**: Focus on curated/positive experiences, typically via subscription models, but lack scale and actionable data.

**Market Cap**:
- Yelp: ~$2.06B (Aug 2025)
- TripAdvisor: ~$1.96B (Aug 2025)

This suggests a **mature but plateaued industry**, leaving room for niche disruption.
