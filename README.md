# 🚀 Building FoodRatings: Learning State-of-the-Art Tech as I Go  

Hi everyone 👋  

I’ve just started working on a project I’ve been thinking about for a while: **FoodRatings** — an app that lets people rate restaurants, canteens, hotels, and any place that serves food. But instead of just building a simple review system, I’m using this as an opportunity to **learn the latest technologies** and share the journey openly.  

This repo will be my **“learn in public” space** — every commit, issue, and discussion is part of the story.  

---

## 🎯 What I’m Building  
FoodRatings will go beyond star reviews. I’ll be experimenting with:  
- Detailed feedback (service, food quality, cleanliness, staff behavior).  
- Anonymous or identifiable reviews (with optional incentives).  
- Training modules for restaurant staff, complete with certificates.  
- Business-facing insights: APIs, dashboards, and bulk data exports.

## 🛠️ How I’m Building It (Tech Stack – always evolving)  

I’ll be pushing myself to use **modern, state-of-the-art tools**. Expect me to tinker with:  

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (React Server Components + App Router), TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui for design system.  
- **Backend**: Serverless functions (Vercel/Cloudflare Workers), or a lightweight Node.js backend with Prisma.  
- **Database**: Postgres (via Supabase or Neon) with row-level security.  
- **AI Integration**: GPT-5 for sentiment analysis, summarizing feedback, and powering staff training recommendations.  
- **Infra / DevOps**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Docker for containerization, maybe Kubernetes if it makes sense.  
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, PostHog for analytics.  
- **Monetization Tech**: Stripe for payments, certificate issuance pipeline (PDF generation + LinkedIn sharing).  

This stack might change — and that’s part of the fun.

## 📚 Learn With Me  

The goal isn’t just to ship an app, but to **share what I learn**:  
- Blog posts (like this) on architecture decisions.  
- Code walkthroughs in README and GitHub Issues.  
- Tutorials when I get something working (e.g., “How I integrated GPT-5 into review analysis”).  
- Mistakes & rewrites — because those are the best lessons.  

I’ll be treating this repo like a **living notebook**.

## 🧪 First Steps  

1. ✅ Repo created: [FoodRating](https://github.com/msjammu/FoodRating)  
2. 📝 Writing requirements & SOW.  
3. 🔜 Setting up SWE agent to help scaffold the project.  
4. 🎨 Designing initial database schema for ratings.  

Stay tuned — this will be messy, experimental, but hopefully valuable for anyone learning modern full-stack development.
